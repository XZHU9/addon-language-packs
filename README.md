# Loftux Addons Language packs

This project contains sources files and projects for localization of Loftux Add-ons.  
Some of these add-ons are proprietary, so this project only gives you access to the properties files.

## Tools needed
You need to download and install OmegaT http://www.omegat.org/.  
You also need the Okapi Filter plugin to support JSON files http://okapiframework.org/wiki/index.php?title=Okapi_Filters_Plugin_for_OmegaT  
Follow the install instructions for each tool.

## Contributing a localization
If you want to contribute, clone this project. Open the language you want to localize to with OmegaT.

Once you have done the localization, create a pull request. Most important is to commit the tmx files (files ending with tmx). From there we will take over and incorporate to our Add-ons.
